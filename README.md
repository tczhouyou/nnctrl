# Neural Network Control

In this repo, we explored different possibilities to simulate or control dynamic systems with deep neural networks. 

In the folder "ANN", we implemented and will implement different kinds of neural networks including:

1. basic_models including simple forward neural networks;
2. different arithmetic neural networks including natural arithmetic logic units (NALU) and equation learner (EQL)

In the folder "GNN", we implemented and will implement different graphic neural network structure.
